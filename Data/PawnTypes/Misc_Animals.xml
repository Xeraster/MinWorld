			The way cattoids have sex is: 
			First, the female [REDACTED] her [REDACTED] until the male [REDACTED] but the male cannot fill the female's [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] until a Bemale comes along and inserts its [REDACTED] into the male's [REDACTED] and then [REDACTED] while singing the Zimbabwe national anthem. This will only work while either a nearby Xemale [REDACTED] with its [REDACTED] or a Spooid watches from a closet dressed up as spiderman. If at any point a Xemale with the same blood type as the Bemale gets so drunk that it disposes its empty drinking container into the wrong recycling bin, the male, female, bemale, and either spooid or additional xemale has to start over from the beginning unless the spooid plays in a Mariachi band. If no spooid was involved in the [REDACTED] then the female has to insert her [REDACTED] into the bemale's [REDACTED] until it starts turning orange, otherwise the entire process has to be started over from the beginning. 

			Depending on a huge number of preconditions that are simply too extensive and complicated to describe here, either the female, one of the xemales or the spooid will give birth to a baby cattoid of at least one of the 5 genders exactly 69 days and 420 seconds later.
